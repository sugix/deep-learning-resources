## ML Strategy

### Objectives


- Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important
- Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
- Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
- Define human-level performance
- Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects
- Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset

- Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning
- Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets
